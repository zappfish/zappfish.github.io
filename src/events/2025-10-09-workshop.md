**Workshop purpose:**

* We will present and test the beta version of the toxicology-phenotype submission form.

* We will receive  immediate feedback on the beta version of the submission form.

* We will guide testers on how to share feedback throughout the testing period (after the workshop). 


**Workshop preparation:**

* Please pick a toxicology/environmental exposure example, including an image of the fish and all the information you would use to report this result. Feel free to use an example from your lab, or from the literature. Have this example ready when joining the workshop: it will be used in an exercise to identify all pieces of information required when reporting data.
