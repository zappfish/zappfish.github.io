* We will do some exercises to identify the pieces of information that are crucial for reporting phenotypes associated with toxicology/environmental exposure.

* We will also review the Zebrafish Phenotype Ontology and present options on how to use it as a standard for phenotype reporting.

* We will choose the official name for the project.

**Workshop preparation:**

* Please pick a toxicology/environmental exposure example, including an image of the fish and all the information you would use to report this result. Feel free to use an example from your lab, or from the literature. Have this example ready when joining the workshop: it will be used in an exercise to identify all pieces of information required when reporting data.

* Do you have an idea for the name of this Zebrafish Toxicology Phenotype Atlas project? Please submit it [here](https://forms.gle/SsSwTNuB1B6YDdRG6).

* Please note that attendees will use Google Sheets to participate in the exercises. Please check that you are (or will be) able to access and edit Google Sheets.
