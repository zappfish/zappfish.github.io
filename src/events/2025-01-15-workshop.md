**Workshop goals and content**
* We introduced the project, reviewed goals, and outlined how the community will engage, including communication plans.

* We asked participants to share the following information if available:

    * SOPs or protocols used to annotate phenotypes

    * Images of a phenotype from any application (it does not need to be from a drug application experiment), depicting:

        - the funniest/strangest phenotype 

        - the most common phenotype 

        - the hardest phenotype to annotate

    * a problem or challenge related to data integration
  
* We reviewed SOPs and protocols currently used, as well as images of the most common, strangest, and hardest-to-annotate phenotype.
