Zebrafish as an animal model have greatly advanced toxicology and environmental studies, however, the lack of standards to report toxicological exposure and phenotypic outcomes impedes comparative studies.

Zebrafish Toxicology Phenotype Atlas Project, known as ZAPP or Zebrafish Atlas Phenotype Project, will create a new zebrafish toxico-phenotype atlas filled with images annotated with terms from the zebrafish phenotype ontology standard and representing exposures using a new toxico-pheno data model. This community-driven standards initiative will engage diverse stakeholders in toxicology and environmental health sciences to ensure the relevance of and consensus on the newly created standards and atlas and their long-term sustainability.
