The Community plays an integral role in the success of this project. 

* We will bring together a community of zebrafish toxicology scientists and toxicology and environmental health experts to discuss use cases, priorities, gather requirements, and organize testing. 

* We will engage researchers of the toxicology zebrafish community to create and submit images and phenotype annotations. 

* We will include ontologists and data standards experts to ensure that standards conform to bioinformatics and FAIR principles.

* We will foster a sustainable community by giving members the opportunities and tools to participate in this project: we will develop tutorials and organize training workshops, we will involve this community in the development of standard operating procedures (SOP) and curation guidelines. 

* We will create an environment in which every participant feels comfortable and empowered to actively participate. Incentives to participate will include travel funding and attribution of atlas and standards contributions, and usage metrics reported to contributors.

(upcoming) Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)
</summary>

A Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) will be established and consulted yearly to ensure guidance and progress of the project.  It will provide feedback on the scope of work, priorities, and project evaluation. 

The composition of the SAB is still to be determined, but it will be chaired by the consultant Jon Hamm and will include membership from ZFIN, and members from the toxicology and zebrafish communities.
